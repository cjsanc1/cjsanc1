# Hi my name is Christopher Sanchez
Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Christopher Sanchez, and I am a passionate software developer. I am currently focusing on diving deeper into React and building exciting web applications.

## About me
I recently completed a rigorous bootcamp program at General Assembly, where I acquired comprehensive knowledge and hands-on experience in web development. Throughout the bootcamp, I worked on various projects, collaborating with a diverse group of talented individuals and expanding my problem-solving abilities.

My primary interest lies in backend development, where I enjoy architecting and building scalable and efficient server-side applications. I have experience with several backend technologies, including Node.js, Express.js, and databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL. I am continuously exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my backend development skills.
